      <div class="modal-title">The Mapping of Gender-related Killings</div>
      <p>
        Every day in Turkey, we face the news of gender-related killings which is overlooked most of the time and done nothing about it to solve. It is troublesome to reach out to official detailed information about gender-related killings in Turkey because of the non-transparent attitude of institutions and NGO's. But we appreciate the efforts in the way to create solutions for this field and data works of the independent press.

For this predicament,  website <a href="https://fe-map.github.io/map/">https://fe-map.github.io/map/</a>
intends to build a dataset, accumulate all the documented and secured data in a database by the details of how, where and why innocent girls and women killed, to expose this brutal shame, prevent, and create consciousness.

Our commitment is fulfilled by fetching details from the news that appeared on the internet with proof as "Man Terrorism on Woman and Girl".
<br/><br/>
All humanity is invited to strive with us to solve this disgraceful problem.
